Minimal Weaver client setup for playing/testing/what-you-fancy.

Caveat: This sdk is still in alpha. It probably will undergo significant changes before it gets to any stage that we will maintain.

This repo is for playtesting the weaver-sdk, it requires a running weaver-server with a connection to a database. This repo functions as a showcase of basic weaver-sdk functionality, and will be updated in line with other weaver-sdk improvments.

Happy weaving!
